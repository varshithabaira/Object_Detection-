Image Preprocessing for Object Detection using OpenCV – A Step-by-Step Guide
Recently, I worked on a coin detection project using OpenCV, and I’d love to share what I learned about the crucial role of image preprocessing in object detection. Techniques like thresholding, dilation, and erosion significantly improve detection accuracy by refining the input image.
 Here’s the step-by-step process I followed:
 1. Thresholding
  Converts the grayscale image into a binary image (black & white).
  Helps isolate the objects (coins) from the background.
  I used cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV to invert the image — coins appear white (foreground), background becomes black.
 2. Dilation
  Expands white regions (foreground).
  Fills small gaps and connects broken parts of objects.
  Enhances coin visibility for better detection.
 3. Erosion
  Shrinks white regions slightly.
  Removes small noise and unwanted artifacts.
  Helps separate closely placed coins.
 4. Final Dilation
  Restores the original size of objects post-erosion.
  Ensures clean contours and smooth edges for accurate detection.
 After preprocessing, I used cv2.findContours() to detect and count the coins. This structured pipeline ensures meaningful objects are highlighted while noise is minimized — a critical step in object detection and segmentation tasks.
 These fundamental techniques may seem simple, but they are incredibly powerful when used effectively in computer vision workflows.
